# Week-4-Homework

This is an empty Phonegap example with jQuery and core Phonegap plugins included. Edit the index.html, index.js, and index.css files inside of the www folder to include the work you've done so far in this class. You do not need to have this finished by next class, however create a pull reqiest with your work in progress so I can see where you are at.
